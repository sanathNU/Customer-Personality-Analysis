This is a Machine Learning project that involves EDA and clustering of customers of a company based on their choices. <br>
Basically, this uses multiple Unsupervised Learning techniques to form optimal number of clusters to divide the customers into. <br>
### **Dataset** <br>
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis
### **Libraries Used** <br>
EDA libraries:  numpy, pandas, seaborn, plotly , SMOTE<br>
ML Libraries:  sklearn, yellowbrick, scipy
### **Algorithms Used** <br>
1. K-Means Clustering
2. Gaussian Mixture Model 
3. Mean-Shift

This was a pretty fun project! Learnt a lot from this! <br>
Awesome ppl who worked with me on this are Dheraj S K, Sahani S, Nesiga, Sumanth H and Mythili!
